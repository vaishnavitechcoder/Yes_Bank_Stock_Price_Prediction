# Yes_Bank_Stock_Price_Prediction

## Project Summary
* The Yes Bank Stock Price Prediction project is an endeavor to develop an accurate machine learning model capable of forecasting future stock prices for Yes Bank. The project revolves around analyzing historical data to derive meaningful insights and patterns that can aid in predicting the stock prices. The dataset utilized for this project comprises 185 rows and 4 columns, including the Date, Open, High, Low, and Close prices.
* The primary objective of this project is to construct a regression model where the Close price serves as the dependent variable, while the Open, High, and Low prices function as independent variables. By leveraging the relationship between these variables, the model aims to accurately predict the future Close prices of Yes Bank stocks.
* The project is divided into several key steps, each playing a crucial role in achieving the ultimate goal of developing an effective stock price prediction model.
* The initial step involves gathering the dataset, ensuring the absence of missing values, and organizing the columns. The Date column is set as the index, while the Open, High, Low, and Close prices are allocated as separate columns for analysis.
* In some cases, additional features can be derived from existing data to enhance the model's predictive capabilities. For instance, lag features or technical indicators might be constructed from the price data to capture pertinent information. This step aims to enrich the dataset and improve the model's ability to capture complex

## Problem Statement
Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month. The main objective is to predict the stockâ€™s closing price of the month

## Conclusion
In the Yes Bank price prediction project, various machine learning models were implemented and evaluated. The chosen model, such as Ridge regression with optimized hyperparameters, was able to make predictions on the Yes Bank stock price. However, to assess the project's success or draw specific conclusions, further evaluation, comparison, and analysis of the model's performance against appropriate evaluation metrics and business objectives would be required.
